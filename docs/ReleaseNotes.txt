---------------------------------------------------------

AMD AOCL-LibMem Contents
---------------------------

AOCL-LibMem is a library of the most widely used string/memory functions of
Glibc optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This shared library should be
preloaded by application to replace standard string/memory functions for
better performance gains on AMD Zen microarchitectures.
a) By default this library will choose the best fit implementation w.r.t
the underlying micro-architectural support for CPU features, instructions,
cache, and threads per CCX.
b) This library also provides tunables for the user to choose specific
implementation of the function as per the application requirements.
